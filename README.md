# Gorban's H family of Lyapunove functions: software and figures
Software and figures for paper  "Universal Gorbanâ€™s Entropies: Geometric Case Study" in the Entropy journal
This repository contains four folders for four considered models. Each model contains several submodels with different figure names.
Description of file names is presented below:

## Linear model. Folder name is "Linear Isomerisation"
There are two submodels: with detailed ballance and with complex balance but without detained balance. Six different set of parameters is considered for each submodel.
All figures are started from "Mod2" prefix.
There are following types of figures:
1. DirectNNN is partial equilibria lines and projections from point c for equilibrium witn number NNN
1. LevelsNNN is partial equilibria lines and level sets of Gorban's H for equilibrium witn number NNN
1. LevelsBHNNN is partial equilibria lines and level sets of Boltzmann's H for equilibrium witn number NNN
1. TrajectN_M is partial equilibria lines and trajectory for equilibrium N and set of reaction rate constants M for system with complex balance
1. TrajectDetN_M is partial equilibria lines and trajectory for equilibrium N and set of reaction rate constants M for system with detailed balance
1. TrajectHN_M presents graphs of partial and total Gorban's H for full reaction time equilibrium N and set of reaction rate constants M for system with complex balance
1. TrajectDetHN_M presents graphs of partial and total Gorban's H for full reaction time equilibrium N and set of reaction rate constants M for system with detailed balance
1. TrajectHTN_M presents graphs of partial and total Gorban's H for initial time interval equilibrium N and set of reaction rate constants M for system with complex balance
1. TrajectDetHTN_M presents graphs of partial and total Gorban's H for initial time interval  equilibrium N and set of reaction rate constants M for system with detailed balance
